About HCA

Nashville-based HCA is one of the nation's leading providers of healthcare services, operating 171 locally managed hospitals and 119 freestanding surgery centers in 20 states and the United Kingdom. With its founding in 1968, HCA created a new model for hospital care in the United States, using combined resources to strengthen hospitals, deliver patient-focused care and improve the practice of medicine. HCA has conducted a number of clinical studies, including one that demonstrated that full-term delivery is healthier than early elective delivery of babies and another that identified a clinical protocol that can reduce bloodstream infections in ICU patients by 44 percent. HCA is a learning healthcare system that uses its more than 27 million annual patient encounters to advance science, improve patient care and save lives.

The HCA Clinical Services Group is responsible for establishing HCA Clinical Strategic Priorities for HCA to be the recognized leader in care delivery achieving world class outcomes. The CSG purpose is to drive excellent care at scale.

About HCA

Nashville-based HCA is one of the nation's leading providers of healthcare services, operating 171 locally managed hospitals and 119 freestanding surgery centers in 20 states and the United Kingdom. With its founding in 1968, HCA created a new model for hospital care in the United States, using combined resources to strengthen hospitals, deliver patient-focused care and improve the practice of medicine. HCA has conducted a number of clinical studies, including one that demonstrated that full-term delivery is healthier than early elective delivery of babies and another that identified a clinical protocol that can reduce bloodstream infections in ICU patients by 44 percent. HCA is a learning healthcare system that uses its more than 27 million annual patient encounters to advance science, improve patient care and save lives.

The HCA Clinical Services Group is responsible for establishing HCA Clinical Strategic Priorities for HCA to be the recognized leader in care delivery achieving world class outcomes. The CSG purpose is to drive excellent care at scale.
Data Science is a new function within CDM focusing on utilizing our data resources to improve the clinical and operating performance of HCA. This team is focused on identifying such opportunities and working with the wider organization to operationalize them.
Data Scientist 1 is the level position in this specialty intended for an individual of little direct experience.

The role of the data scientist is to use mathematics, programming and visualization to discover, in partnership with the business, opportunities and insights arising from HCA data systems. This role is firmly customer facing, with an expectation of constant contact, communication and iteration with both clinical and business customers to define questions, explore solutions and present results. As such the data scientist must be comfortable and capable of clearly communicating the nature and results of complex analytics to non-technical users in written, spoken and visual means.

On the technical front the data scientist must be comfortable with 'data wrangling'. That is, the ability to identify, and extract raw data from primary transactions systems such as databases.

About HCA

Nashville-based HCA is one of the nation's leading providers of healthcare services, operating 171 locally managed hospitals and 119 freestanding surgery centers in 20 states and the United Kingdom. With its founding in 1968, HCA created a new model for hospital care in the United States, using combined resources to strengthen hospitals, deliver patient-focused care and improve the practice of medicine. HCA has conducted a number of clinical studies, including one that demonstrated that full-term delivery is healthier than early elective delivery of babies and another that identified a clinical protocol that can reduce bloodstream infections in ICU patients by 44 percent. HCA is a learning healthcare system that uses its more than 27 million annual patient encounters to advance science, improve patient care and save lives.

The HCA Clinical Services Group is responsible for establishing HCA Clinical Strategic Priorities for HCA to be the recognized leader in care delivery achieving world class outcomes. The CSG purpose is to drive excellent care at scale.
